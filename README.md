# sb_perl

Perl sandbox for variety of templates, and tutorial snippets.

This repository could be a useful starting point for writing scripts, or demoing how to write scripts.
It could be used on its own, or deployed on a virtual machine within the workspace [https://github.com/panchul/workspace](https://github.com/panchul/workspace)

The ```/doc``` folder of the ```workspace``` repo has the documentation. 

I will gradually migrate the notes I have to this repository. To keep track of what I am adding:

+ convert_man_page
    - Demoes how to format a file
     
+ loading_configs
    - Demoes how to convert a file into hash table, with or without CPAN libraries.

+ kafka_config_generator
    - A template how to generate interconnected configuration of multiple config files for different nodes.
    - Besides config files (for Zookeeper and Kafka as example), creates a deployment shell script to place the files at the nodes.
